    <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
    <p class="note">
      This privacy policy applies to the Walking Buddy mobile application, which
      is provided by Áron Márton as an ad supported service. The Service is
      provided AS IS.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong
        >What information does the application obtain and how is it
        used?</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p><strong>User provided information</strong></p>
    <p>
      The application acquires the information you supply when you download and
      register the application. Registration with the Service Provider is not
      mandatory, but some features may be unavailable without registration. The
      Service Provider may use the information you provide to contact you from
      time to time with important information, required notices, and marketing
      promotions.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Automatically collected information</strong></p>
    <p>
      The application may collect certain information automatically, including
      the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device's unique device ID,
      the IP address of your mobile device, your mobile operating system, the
      type of mobile internet browser you use, and information about how you use
      the application.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Access to health and fitness data</strong></p>
    <p>
      The application requests access to your physical activity data (such as
      step count and movement data). This data is processed locally on your
      device and is used exclusively to calculate and reward you with in-app
      digital currency based on your physical activity. This digital currency
      lets you purchase food for your virtual dog within the application. The
      Service Provider does not transmit this health data to external servers
      for storage and does not sell it to third parties.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong
        >Does the application collect precise real-time location
        information?</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      The application does not gather precise information about the location of
      your mobile device. It collects your device's approximate location to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Geolocation services:</strong> Provide personalized content,
        relevant recommendations, and location-based services.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Analytics and improvements:</strong> Use aggregated and
        anonymized location data to analyze user behavior, identify trends, and
        improve the application's performance and functionality.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Third-party services:</strong> Periodically transmit anonymized
        location data to external services that help enhance the application and
        optimize offerings.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong
        >Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the
        application?</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external
      services to aid the Service Provider in improving the application and the
      service. The Service Provider may share your information with third
      parties as described in this privacy statement. The application uses
      third-party services that have their own privacy policies. These include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>AdMob</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Service Provider may disclose user provided and automatically
      collected information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        As required by law (for example, to comply with a subpoena or similar
        legal process).
      </li>
      <li>
        When disclosure is necessary to protect rights, your safety or the
        safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
      </li>
      <li>
        With trusted service providers who work on their behalf, have no
        independent use of the information disclosed, and have agreed to adhere
        to this privacy statement.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>What are my opt-out rights?</strong></p>
    <p>
      You can halt all collection of information by uninstalling the application
      using your device's standard uninstall process or your app marketplace or
      network.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Data retention policy and managing your information</strong></p>
    <p>
      The Service Provider retains user provided data for as long as you use the
      application and for a reasonable time afterward. Automatically collected
      information is retained for up to 24 months and may then be stored in
      aggregate. To request deletion of user provided data, contact
      infoaron03@gmail.com. Some or all user provided data may be required for
      the application to function properly.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Children</strong></p>
    <p>
      The Service Provider does not use the application to knowingly solicit
      data from or market to children under the age of 13. If the Service
      Provider becomes aware that a child under 13 has provided personal
      information, it will be deleted immediately. If you are a parent or
      guardian and believe your child has provided personal information, please
      contact infoaron03@gmail.com so the Service Provider can take appropriate
      action.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
    <p>
      The Service Provider provides physical, electronic, and procedural
      safeguards to protect information processed and maintained, limiting
      access to authorized personnel. While reasonable security measures are in
      place, no security system can prevent all potential breaches.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Changes</strong></p>
    <p>
      This privacy policy may be updated from time to time. The Service Provider
      will notify you of changes by updating this page. You are advised to check
      this policy regularly. Continued use of the application after changes are
      posted constitutes approval of all changes. This policy is effective as of
      2025-11-12.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Your consent</strong></p>
    <p>
      By using the application, you consent to the Service Provider processing
      your information as set forth in this privacy policy now and as amended.
      "Processing" includes using cookies on a device and otherwise using or
      touching information in any way, including collecting, storing, deleting,
      using, combining, and disclosing information.
    </p>
